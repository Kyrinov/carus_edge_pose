Carus Edge: Medical Intelligence Library (RAG Optimized)

Document Version: 1.2

Optimization Strategy: Semantic Chunking / Metadata Anchoring

Focus: Geriatric Monitoring & Predictive Health Analysis
[SEC-01]: Gait & Mobility Analysis

Metadata: {category: mobility, sensor_source: camera/vision, priority: high}
1.1 Fall Risk Indicators (Gait)

    Stride Variability: Any increase in step-to-step timing variability >15% over a 7-day rolling average is a high-priority flag for vestibular or neurological decline.

    Cadence: Normal range for ages 70+: 90–120 steps/minute. A persistent drop below 80 steps/minute indicates a potential "pre-frailty" state.

    Clearance: Decrease in toe-clearance height (<1.5cm) correlates directly with trip hazards on carpet-to-hardwood transitions.

1.2 TUG (Timed Up and Go) Benchmarks

    < 10 Seconds: Low fall risk (Independently mobile).

    10–20 Seconds: Moderate risk; suggests the need for environmental audit (removing rugs, adding grab bars).

    > 20 Seconds: High risk; requires immediate physical therapy consultation and likely assistive device adjustment.

[SEC-02]: Vital Sign Thresholds (Geriatric Baseline)

Metadata: {category: vitals, sensor_source: wearable/ECG, priority: critical}
2.1 Cardiovascular Stability

    Resting Heart Rate (RHR): 60–100 bpm is standard. Note: Beta-blockers may lower this to 50–60 bpm.

    Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) Flags: Identify "irregularly irregular" rhythms. If detected via PPG sensor, cross-reference with "Activity Level" metadata. If detected during sleep, trigger high-priority alert.

    HRV (Heart Rate Variability): A sudden 30% drop in overnight HRV is a leading indicator of systemic stress or brewing infection (UTI/Respiratory) in elderly populations.

2.2 Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)

    Target: 94%–98% for healthy seniors.

    Chronic Warning: 88%–92% (often acceptable in COPD patients, check baseline).

    Acute Alert: Any drop below 88% for >5 minutes during inactivity.

[SEC-03]: Medication & Interaction Logic

Metadata: {category: pharmacology, logic: interference_check}
3.1 High-Risk Combinations (Beers Criteria)

    NSAIDs + Anticoagulants: Extreme risk of GI bleed. (e.g., Ibuprofen + Warfarin/Eliquis).

    Benzodiazepines: High correlation with nocturnal falls. Monitor gait clearance 2–4 hours post-administration.

    Diuretics: Ensure monitoring of orthostatic hypotension (BP drop when standing). Trigger "Gait Analysis" immediately upon user rising from bed.
